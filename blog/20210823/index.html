        <h1>Where have I been?</h1>
        <p>I haven't been active on either YouTube or my own Discord server, or Twitter or anything. I have stopped doing tech support since then. Where have I been?</p>
        <p>Throughtout the summer, I have been busy like mad with all the things that's been happening. I don't want to talk about it but yeah, it's nothing out of ordinary. I had look back into what I have been doing for the pass few months, tech support-school-tech support-school-tech support-school, and it just keeps repeating, it's like I have thrown myself into a spinning circle that goes like round and round and round and just doing the same thing.</p>
        <p>I have realized, one day, that this has to be stopped. I know it has to be stopped. This cannot go on. Anymore. So I sprang into action and asked the mods if they can ban me from the tech support channel. They did exactly what I asked them to do on every single account that I own.</p>
